## ðŸ”‘ Steps Performed :
1. **Chose VPN Service** â€“ Registered with `ProtonVPN` (free account).  
2. **Downloaded & Installed Client** â€“ Installed `ProtonVPN` desktop client.  
3. **Connected to VPN Server** â€“ Chose the closest server for stable speed.  
4. **Verified IP Address** â€“ Used [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) to confirm IP changed.  
5. **Tested Encrypted Traffic** â€“ Browsed websites via VPN to ensure traffic was tunneled securely.

  ## Findings:

  - **Performance**: Browsing speed was slightly reduced compared to direct connection (expected due to encryption and routing through VPN servers).

---

## Tools Used:

- **For VPN:** [Windscribe](https://windscribe.com/) `Free`, [Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com/) `Free`
- **For IP Check:** [What is My IP Address](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) `Free`
- **For Speed Test:** [Speed Test](https://www.speedtest.net/) `Free`

## Research VPN Encryption & Privacy

- **Encryption Standards:** Most reputable VPNs (like ProtonVPN and Windscribe) use AES-256 encryption, which is considered military-grade and virtually unbreakable by brute force. Some also support ChaCha20 (used with WireGuard protocol) for faster performance.

- **Tunneling Protocols:** VPNs rely on secure tunneling protocols such as OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPSec, and WireGuard to create an encrypted channel between the device and the VPN server. These ensure data confidentiality and integrity.

- **IP & Location Masking:** A VPN hides your real IP address and replaces it with the VPN serverâ€™s IP, making online activity harder to trace back to you and protecting against website tracking or ISP monitoring.

- **Privacy Features:**

  * Prevents ISP and public Wi-Fi providers from seeing browsing activity.

  * Protects sensitive data (e.g., logins, banking info) from interception.

  * Some VPNs include a no-logs policy, ensuring that even the provider does not track user activity.

- **Limitations:** While VPNs improve privacy, they are not a full anonymity tool â€” the VPN provider can still technically see your traffic unless they enforce strict no-log policies. For complete anonymity, tools like Tor may be needed in combination with a VPN.

## Summary:

VPNs provide an extra layer of privacy and security by encrypting internet traffic and masking real IP addresses. They are especially useful when using public Wi-Fi or bypassing geo-restrictions. However, free VPNs may come with limitations in speed, server availability, and potential trust issues with providers.
